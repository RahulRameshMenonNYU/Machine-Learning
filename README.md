Aim- Given instances of customers who default and not, train a machine learning algorithm that is able to predict who may deafult and who might not. The model should be robust (perform well across different metrics - accuracy, precision , recall, f1 scores)
- Train and build a benchmark model for classification task based on Logistic Regression
- Train and build other models based on Random Forest, gradient boost, ada boost and a voting classifier
- For the models that show promise (score well across multiple metrics) on train set cross validation, perform tuning using GridSearchCV
- The Final tuned model can be used to predict on test set. Also ask the benchmark model of Logistic Regression to predict on the test set
- Compare the performance of the tuned model with that of the benchmark model to see improvement in performance.
